<h1 id="select2-documentation">Select2 Documentation</h1>
<p><a href="https://github.com/select2/select2.github.io">This repository</a> holds the latest documentation for
<a href="https://select2.github.io">Select2</a>.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-this-">What is this?</h2>
<p>The documentation is automatically extracted from the <code>docs</code> directory at the
<a href="https://github.com/select2/select2">Select2 source repository</a>. This is done periodically by
the maintainers of Select2.</p>
<h2 id="how-can-i-fix-an-issue-in-these-docs-">How can I fix an issue in these docs?</h2>
<p>If you are reading this from the source repository, within the <code>docs</code> directory,
then you&#39;re already in the right place. You can fork the source repository,
commit your changes, and then make a pull request and it will be reviewed.</p>
<p><strong>If you are reading this from the
<a href="https://github.com/select2/select2.github.io">documentation repository</a>, you are in the wrong place.</strong>
Pull requests made directly to the documentation repository will be ignored and
eventually closed, so don&#39;t do that.</p>
<h2 id="how-can-i-build-these-docs-manually-">How can I build these docs manually?</h2>
<p>In the <a href="https://github.com/select2/select2">main Select2 repository</a>, you can build the
documentation by executing</p>
<pre><code class="lang-bash">grunt docs
</code></pre>
<p>Which will start up the documentation on port 4000. You will need
<a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> installed to build the documentation.</p>
